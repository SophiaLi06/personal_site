## Education
I got my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the College of Engineering at Cornell University.

I went to Tsinghua University High School for middle school and high school (yes, Tsinghua University High School in fact consists of both a middle school and a high school).

## Research Interests
+ Systems and Networking
+ Security
+ Machine Learning

## Trivia
### Hometown
I was born and raised in Beijing, China.

### Hobby
+ I enjoy the fresh air and often wander outdoors (taking long walks is healing). I also hit the gym quite often.

+ I like going to movies A LOT! My taste is pretty diverse ~~(but I'm not a fan of thrillers)~~ (edited Feb. 2026: my PhD journey has toughened me!).

+ I watch funny videos on Bilibili almost every day. My close friends know that I'm pretty good at mimicking those videos.

+ I became a fan of the theater after I went to a Broadway show of _The Phantom Of The Opera_ in 2018.

+ I also paint, dance, and go to hockey games sometimes. After moving to Boston, I have also got into watching Red Sox.

+ And if you count "housekeeping" as a hobby as well, then yes that is also one of my hobbies.
<!-- end of the list -->

### Fun Facts
+ Except for bedtime, I'm rarely in my dorm.

+ I'm not interested in cooking ~~or even eating good food~~ (edited Feb 2026: I don't know what's wrong with me back then...). You know, frozen meals can be decent and cheap...

+ I have a north-eastern accent when I speak Chinese.

+ There are actually two videos with me as a dancer out there on Bilibili.

+ My favorite musical actor is [Ayanga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayanga).

+ I know quite a bit about the idol industry. (edited Feb 2026: I've (finally!) grown out of my fan girl years! But still, I know quite a bit about that industry XD)

+ I was trained to become an artist for nearly six years before I entered middle school. (In fact, I applied to my middle school as an art student. But somehow I did super well on the Math section of the entrance exam but not so well on the drawing section. I was assigned to the science track instead.)
