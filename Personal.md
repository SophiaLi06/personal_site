## Education
I'm currently a senior majoring Computer Science in the College of Engineering at Cornell University.

I went to Tsinghua University High School for middle school and high school (yes Tsinghua University High School in fact consists of both a middle school and a high school).

## Research Interests
+ Systems and Networking
+ Security
+ Machine Learning

## Trivia
### Hometown
I was born and raised in Beijing, China.

### Hobby
+ I enjoy fresh air and wandering outdoors. I jog when it is warm, and take long walks instead when it is cold. I also go to gym whenever I feel like doing so.

+ I like going to movies a LOT! My taste is pretty diverse (but I'm not a fan of thrillers).

+ I watch funny videos on [bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com/) almost every day before going to bed. My close friends know that I'm pretty good at mimicing those videos.

+ I became a fan of musical and stage performances after I went to a Broadway show of _The Phantom Of The Opera_. I try to make some room for a broadway show every time I'm in NYC.

+ I also paint, dance, and go to hockey games sometime. 

+ And if you count "house keeping" as a hobby as well, then yes that is also one of my hobbies.

### Fun Facts
+ Except bedtime, I'm almost never in my dorm.

+ According to many of my friends, I appeared to be a "very serious" and somewhat "scary" person when they first met me. Later they were surprised to discover that I was actually quite "逗比" (this is a Chinese word that is used to describe people who make others laugh by behaving in funny or even ridiculous ways).

+ I'm not interested in cooking or even eating good food.

+ I have a north-eastern accent when I speak Chinese.

+ I can recite the scripts of a bunch of famous videos on [bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com/).

+ There are actually two videos with me as a dancer out there on [bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com/), but I bet noboday cares to find them.

+ My favorite musical actor is [Ayanga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayanga).

+ My favorite British actors are Tom Hiddleston and Henry Cavill (I really can't decide which one I like more).

+ I know a lot about K-POP and Johnny & Associates idols. My favorite K-POP group is [Shinhwa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinhwa), and my favorite Johnny & Associate group is [V6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V6_(band)).

+ Though I'm "vertically challenged" right now, I was a basketball player.

+ I was trained to become an artist for nearly six years before I entered middle school. (In fact, I applied to my middle school as an art student. But somehow I did super well on the Math section of the entrance exam, and not so well on the drawing section. So, I got placed onto the science track by my school instead.)

+ Both of my parents majored Computer Science.
