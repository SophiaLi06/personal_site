## Education
I got my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the College of Engineering at Cornell University.

I went to Tsinghua University High School for middle school and high school (yes, Tsinghua University High School in fact consists of both a middle school and a high school).

## Research Interests
+ Systems and Networking
+ Security
+ Machine Learning

## Trivia
### Hometown
I was born and raised in Beijing, China.

### Hobby
+ I enjoy the fresh air and often wander outdoors (taking long walks is healing). I also hit the gym whenever I feel like doing so.

+ I like going to movies A LOT! My taste is pretty diverse (but I'm not a fan of thrillers).

+ I watch funny videos on Bilibili almost every day. My close friends know that I'm pretty good at mimicking those videos.

+ I became a fan of the theater after I went to a Broadway show of _The Phantom Of The Opera_ in 2018.

+ I also paint, dance, and go to hockey games sometimes. After moving to Boston, I have also got into the habit of watching the Red Sox.

+ And if you count "housekeeping" as a hobby as well, then yes that is also one of my hobbies.

### Fun Facts
+ Except for bedtime, I'm rarely in my dorm.

+ According to many of my friends, I appeared to be a "very serious" and somewhat "scary" person when they first met me. Later they were surprised to discover that I was actually quite "逗比" (this is a Chinese word used to describe people who make others laugh by behaving in funny or even ridiculous ways).

+ I'm not interested in cooking or even eating good food. You know, frozen meals can be decent and cheap...

+ I have a north-eastern accent when I speak Chinese.

+ There are actually two videos with me as a dancer out there on Bilibili.

+ My favorite musical actor is [Ayanga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayanga).

+ I know quite a bit about the idol industry. I used to be a fan of K-POP group [Shinhwa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinhwa) (aka Shinhwa Changjo). My favorite J-POP idol group was [V6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V6_(band)) (disbanded). I now follow the activities of Ryota Miyadate and [KinKi Kids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KinKi_Kids) (I got into trouble when I said I am a fan of this duo. There isn't anything sketchy going on here. "KinKi" refers to the Kinki region of Japan, where both members are from). I am also a casual fan of 20th Century (previously a subunit of V6), [SUPER EIGHT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Eight_(group)) (previously known as 関ジャニ∞), and the Jr.s of Starto Entertainment.

+ I was trained to become an artist for nearly six years before I entered middle school. (In fact, I applied to my middle school as an art student. But somehow I did super well on the Math section of the entrance exam but not so well on the drawing section. So, my school placed me on the science track instead.)
