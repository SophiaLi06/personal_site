## Projects
+ DAPter

+ PECAM
    + A mobile privacy-enhanced VSA (Video Streaming & Analytics) system that runs on the frontend of a VSA system and performs the reversible privacy-enhanced whole-frame transformation over realtime streaming. 

+ DAPPSCOPE
    + Automatically discovers the discrepancy between a DApp's UI and its contract code.
    + DAPPSCOPE analyzes a DApp’s web code to discover all the smart contract functions that are invoked. Builds a business model graph for each of these functions. Locates the corresponding UI component of each function, and applies NLP techniques to the UI texts to infer the category of the business logic and the function’s particular task. Discovers underlying issues by checking the business model graph against the pre-defined high-level specifications of the inferred business logic and task. 
    + Applied to 22 real-world DApps. Discovered 17 novel safety issues.

+ BookHub
    + Generates book recommendations based on user preferences. Allows users to input a list of books (up to 5) and a list of genres (up to 10) they like. Then recommends a list of books of the preferred genres with Goodreads reviews that are similar to the reviews of users’ favorite books. 
    + Uses information retrieval and machine learning techniques including TF-IDF, cosine similarity, Jaccard similarity, Boolean search, and topic modeling.
    + The project is available at [here](https://cu-bookhub.herokuapp.com/).

<!-- + Weather Station
    + Gets the real-time temperature and humidity from the environment and displays them (temperature in both Celsius and Fahrenheit) on the OLED display every four seconds (the temperature is displayed for 2 seconds, and then the humidity is displayed for 2 seconds).
    + Can also display a scatter plot of the temperature and humidity of the most recent 6 minutes, with one point indicating every minute.
    + Built by connecting an Adafruit DHT11 temperature-humidity sensor and an Adafruit 931 OLED display to an FRDM-K64F board.
    + The demo video is available at [here](https://youtu.be/rXCpg2w4B9Q).
